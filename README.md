# Local Social Networking Protocol (LSNP)

A decentralized peer-to-peer social networking application over UDP. Designed for use in LAN environments, LSNP allows users to post messages, chat privately, share files, create groups, and play games — all without centralized servers.

---

## Features

- **Peer Discovery** via `PING` and `PROFILE` messages
- **Messaging**
  - Public `POST`
  - Private `DM`
  - `FOLLOW` / `UNFOLLOW`
  - `LIKE` / `UNLIKE`
- **File Sharing**
  - Chunked file transfer using `FILE_OFFER`, `FILE_CHUNK`, `FILE_RECEIVED`
- **Group Messaging**
  - Group creation, updates, and messaging (`GROUP_CREATE`, `GROUP_UPDATE`, `GROUP_MESSAGE`)
- **Game Support**
  - Tic Tac Toe with turn-based invites and result reporting
- **Token-based Access Control**
  - Scopes: `broadcast`, `chat`, `file`, `follow`, `group`, `game`
- **Verbose Logging Mode**

## Setup

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- No external libraries required

### Running the Peer

```bash
python main.py
```

Multiple threads will start for:
- Listening for incoming messages
- Periodic `PING`/`PROFILE` broadcast
- Cleaning up stale file offers

   ```
3. File is saved under `received_files/`.
